# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
I started to get more familiar with it towards the last challenge. This is another one where i feel repetition is key
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle? 
I had a very much productive struggle because i had to reach out to different resources for help and to make sure. I suprised myself when i got the third challenge which i thought was the most difficult one on the second try. 
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I definetly need to just keep doing these and pushing myself. I can use codeacademy or just keep messing around in the vs code with made up scenarios.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
I still would love to know how far you can push the for statements and just what else you can do. I feel like we just learned the basis but i feel there is so much more to learn.
